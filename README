illumos gate README - Sept 12, 2010.

This is the illumos gate.  This is the illumos source tree.  It contains
the following subdirectories:

	usr/src	- 		The actual source code

	exception_lists	-	These are lists of exceptional cases
				used to limit noise during builds.
				Ideally this directory would consist of
				only empty files.

Integration Rules:

        All changes must have been reviewed, and approved by and advocate
	(below).  A code review may be performed by someone other than the
	advocate, but the final integration should still be approved by the
	advocate. 

        The advocate will want to see your webrev and hg outgoing -v.  The
	advocate will also ask about your testing, and may ask to see your
	build logs.

        All changes must adhere to typical ON style and quality rules.
        For example, pass full cstyle, applicable lint rules, etc.

        All commits must include either a CDDL license, unless
        approved otherwise by the gatekeeper, or the modified code
	already carries a different license.  Exceptions shall require
	the approval of the gatekeeper.

        Hg commits should have comments of the following form:

        1234 This is a sample bug report synopsis
        4567 If you have a second bug synopsis...
        Reviewed by: codereviewer@somewhere.net
        Approved by: gatekeeper@somewhere.else.com

	Each commit must have at least one bug id that is listed in the
	illumos-gate project at www.illumos.org.

Branches:

        Please talk to the gatekeeper about personal branches.  In general,
        they will be allowed as long as we don't go *too* wild on them.
