These are the following bits that were closed source, for which we need
open replacements:

libc_i18n --    This is probably the most critical part.  We should be able to
                leverage code from one of the BSDs.

Others?
                raidcfg plugins?


There are other tasks we would like to see done:

	* Support for alternative compilers (gcc, including boot up)
	* Self hosting (be able to compile with minimal cross dependencies)
	* Increase lint coverage
	* Increase 64-bit cleanliness
	* Overall Makefile cleanup

Some of these tasks may conflict with overall goals to minimize differences
with upstream.  So that will need to be discussed.
